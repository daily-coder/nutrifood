    title: "apple",
    about: `An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple 
      trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the 
      genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, 
      Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of 
      years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European 
      colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many 
      cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition. Apples 
      grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the 
      resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple 
      cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown 
      without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. 
      Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the 
      resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.There are more than 7,500 known 
      cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, 
      including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone 
      to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by 
      a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was
      sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in 
      apple production. Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, 
      with China accounting for nearly half of the total.`,
    nutrition: `A raw apple is 86% water and 14% carbohydrates, with negligible content of fat 
      and protein. A reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing 100 
      grams provides 52 calories and a moderate content of dietary fiber. 
      Otherwise, there is low content of micronutrients, with the Daily Values of all

    title: "strawberry",
    about: `The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria ananassa) is a widely 
      grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the 
      strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is 
      widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy 
      texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in 
      such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. 
      Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products 
      such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others. The garden strawberry 
      was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria 
      virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was 
      brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714. Cultivars of Fragaria 
       ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry 
      (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the 
      early 17th century.The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a 
      berry. Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy 
      "part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds 
      the ovaries. Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is 
      actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it. In 2019, 
      world production of strawberries was nine million tons, led by China with 40% 
      of the total.`,
    nutrition: `Raw strawberries are 91% water, 8% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contain 
      negligible fat. A 100 gram reference amount of strawberries supplies 33

      good source of manganese (18% DV), and provides several other vitamins and 
      dietary minerals in small amounts. Strawberries contain a modest amount of 
      essential unsaturated fatty acids in the achene (seed) oil.`,

    title: "banana",
    about: `A banana is an elongated, edible fruit botanically a berry produced 
      by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In 
      some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", 
      distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, 
      and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in 
      starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown 
      when ripe. The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost 
      all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species 
      Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated 
      bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa  paradisiaca for the 
      hybrid Musa acuminata  M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. 
      The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used. 
      Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to 
      have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They are grown in 135 
      countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, 
      "banana wine, and banana beer, and as ornamental plants. The world's largest 
      producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for 
      approximately 38% of total production. Worldwide, there is no sharp 
      distinction between "bananas" and "plantains". Especially in the Americas and 
      Europe, "banana" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly 
      those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing 
      countries. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called 
      "plantains". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more kinds of 
      banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not as useful and is 
      not made in local languages. The term "banana" is also used as the common name 
      for the plants that produce the fruit. This can extend to other members of 
      the genus Musa, such as the scarlet banana (Musa coccinea), the pink banana 
      "(Musa velutina), and the Fe'i bananas. It can also refer to members of the 
      genus Ensete, such as the snow banana (Ensete glaucum) and the economically 
      important false banana (Ensete ventricosum). Both genera are in the banana 
      family, Musaceae.`,

      aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually 
      (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through 
      mutations. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin 
      (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal

      The cultivation of grapes began perhaps 8,000 years ago, and the 
      fruit has been used as human food over history. Eaten fresh or in 
      dried form (as raisins, currants and sultanas), grapes also hold 
      cultural significance in many parts of the world, particularly for
      their role in winemaking. Other grape-derived products include

      linear, solid, and approximately 1.25-2.5 cm (0.5-1.0 in) wide, with an acute 
      apex. The plant may produce pink to purple flowers from July to September in 
      the Northern Hemisphere. The bulb is odoriferous and contains outer layers of 
      thin sheathing leaves surrounding an inner sheath that encloses the clove. 
      Often the bulb contains 10 to 20 cloves that are asymmetric in shape, except 
      for those closest to the center. If garlic is planted at the proper time and 
      depth, it can be grown as far north as Alaska. It produces hermaphrodite 
      flowers. It is pollinated by bees, butterflies, moths, and other insects.`,
    nutrition: `In the typical serving size of 1-3 cloves (3-9 grams), garlic provides no 
      significant nutritional value, with the content of all essential nutrients 
      below 10% of the Daily Value (DV) . When expressed per 100 grams, 
      garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (20% or more of the DV), 
      including vitamins B6 and C, and the dietary minerals manganese and phosphorus.

    about: `The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, typically 
      orange in color, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars 
      exist, all of which are domesticated forms of the wild carrot, Daucus 
      carota, native to Europe and Southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated 
      in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most 
      commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves 
      are also eaten. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its enlarged, 
      more palatable, less woody-textured taproot. The carrot is a biennial plant in 
      the umbellifer family, Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while 
      building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three 
      months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars need a 
      month longer (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and 
      beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin 
      B6.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that 
      world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) 
      for 2018 was 40 million tonnes, with 45% of the world total grown in China. 
      Carrots are commonly consumed raw or cooked in various cuisines.`,
    nutrition: `Raw carrots are 88% water, 9% carbohydrates, 0.9% protein, 2.8% dietary fiber, 
      1% ash and 0.2% fat. Carrot dietary fiber comprises mostly cellulose, with 
      smaller proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch. Free sugars in 
      carrot include sucrose, glucose, and fructose. The carrot gets its 
      characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of 
      α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are 
      partly metabolized into vitamin A, providing more than 100% of the 
      Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots are also a 
      good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have

    about: `Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the 
      Cucurbitaceae family that bears usually cylindrical fruits, which are used as 
      culinary vegetables. Considered an annual plant, there are three main 
      varieties of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and seedless—within which several 
      cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates from South Asia, but now 
      grows on most continents, as many different types of cucumber are traded on the 
      global market. In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the 
      genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely related. The 
      cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or 
      other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling 
      tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will 
      sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large 
      leaves that form a canopy over the fruits. The fruit of 
      typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with 
      tapered ends, and may be as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 
      centimeters (4 in) in diameter.Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see 
      nutrition table). In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a 
      type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. 
      However, much like tomatoes and squashes, it is often perceived, prepared, and 
      eaten as a vegetable.`,
    nutrition: `Raw cucumber (with peel) is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and

      micronutrients: it is notable only for vitamin K, at 16% of the Daily Value 
     . Depending on variety, cucumbers may have a mild melon aroma and 
      flavor, in part resulting from unsaturated aldehydes, such as 
      (E,Z)-nona-2,6-dienal, and the cis- and trans- isomers of 2-nonenal. The 
      slightly bitter taste of cucumber rind results from cucurbitacins.`,

    about: `A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a 
      fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. 
      Toadstool generally denotes one poisonous to humans. The standard for the 
      name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; 
      hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, 
      Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, 
      sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety 
      of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to 
      describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce 
      microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its 
      occupant surface.Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more 
      specific names, such as "bolete", "puffball", "stinkhorn", and "morel", and 
      gilled mushrooms themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to their 
      similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term 
      "mushroom" can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the 
      thallus (called mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called 
      mushrooms, or the species itself.`,

    about: `The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, 
      commonly known as the tomato plant. The species originated in western South 
      America, Mexico, and Central America. The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl 
      gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato 
      derived. Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have 
      originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The Aztecs used 
      tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec 
      Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after 
      their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a 
      widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the 
      tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 
      16th century. Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor. They are 
      consumed in diverse ways: raw or cooked, and in many dishes, sauces, salads, 
      and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they 
      are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous 
      varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the 
      world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all 
      seasons of the year. Tomato plants typically grow to 1-3 meters (3-10 ft) in 
      height. They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs 
      support. Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, 
      but are cultivated as annuals. (Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that 
      stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.) The size of 
      the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1-10 cm (1⁄2-4 in)

      species of the genus Allium. The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion 
      which was classified as a separate species until 2010. Its close 
      relatives include garlic, scallion, leek, and chive. This genus also 
      contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated 
      for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (Allium fistulosum), the tree 
      onion (A.  proliferum), and the Canada onion (Allium canadense). The name wild 
      onion is applied to a number of Allium species, but A. cepa is exclusively 
      known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although 
      escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions. The onion 
      is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as 
      an annual and harvested in its first growing season.The onion plant has a fan 
      of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to 
      swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of 
      shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale 
      (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or 
      in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the 
      outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and 
      dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack 
      by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion 
      eelworm, and various fungi which can cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, 
      such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.Onions are 
      cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually served 
      cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be 
      eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped

      most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds. 
      Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds 
      of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled. One 
      variety, celtuce (asparagus lettuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten 
      either raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also 
      gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human 
      consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for 
      lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread 
      throughout the world. As of 2017, world production of lettuce and chicory was 
      27 million tonnes, 56 percent of which came from China. Lettuce was 
      originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant 
      whose seeds were used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its 
      succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans; 
      the latter gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is derived. 
      By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval 
      writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the 
      development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century, cultivars 
      were described that can still be found in modern gardens.Generally grown as a 
      hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it requires relatively low 
      temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by 
      numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal 
      and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with 
      some other species within the genus Lactuca. Although this trait can be a 
      problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to 
      broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.Lettuce is a rich source

      small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain 
      legume and, due to its high oil content, an oil crop. World annual 
      production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016, led by China with 
      38% of the world total. Atypically among legume crop plants, peanut pods 
      develop underground (geocarpy) rather than above ground. With this 
      characteristic in mind, the botanist Carl Linnaeus gave peanuts the specific 
      epithet hypogaea, which means "under the earth." The peanut belongs to the 
      botanical family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), commonly known as the legume, bean, 
      or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic 
      nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules. The capacity to fix nitrogen means

      studies show that regular consumption of peanuts is associated with a lower 
      specific risk of mortality from certain diseases. However, the study 
      designs do not allow cause and effect to be inferred. According to the US Food 
      and Drug Administration, "Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that 
      eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as peanuts) as part of a diet low 
      in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart
      disease.Ranked second after soya beans, peanuts are the world's largest
      source of vegetable oil. They are the main constituent of margarine and are 
      produced commercially as salad and cooking oil.`,

    title: "cashew",
    about: `The cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale) is a tropical evergreen tree native 
      to South America in the genus Anacardium that produces the cashew seed and the 
      cashew apple accessory fruit. The tree can grow as tall as 14 metres (46 
      feet), but the dwarf cultivars, growing up to 6 m (20 ft), prove more 
      profitable, with earlier maturity and greater yields. The cashew seed is 
      commonly considered a snack nut (cashew nut) eaten on its own, used in recipes, 
      or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter. Like the tree, the nut is 
      often simply called a cashew. Cashew allergies are triggered by the proteins 
      found in tree nuts, and cooking often does not remove or change these 
      proteins. In 2019, four million tonnes of cashew nuts were produced 
      globally, with Ivory Coast and India as the leading producers. As well as the 
      nut and fruit, the plant has several other uses. The shell of the cashew seed 
      yields derivatives that can be used in many applications including lubricants, 
      waterproofing, paints, and, starting in World War II, arms production. The 
      cashew apple is a light reddish to yellow fruit, whose pulp and juice can be 
      processed into a sweet, astringent fruit drink or fermented and distilled into 
      liquor.`,
    nutrition: `Raw cashews are 5% water, 30% carbohydrates, 44% fat, and 18% protein. 
      In a 100-gram reference amount, raw cashews provide 553 kilocalories, 67% of 
      the Daily Value (DV) in total fats, 36% DV of protein, 13% DV of dietary fiber 
      and 11% DV of carbohydrates. Cashews are rich sources (20% or more of the 
      DV) of dietary minerals, including particularly copper, manganese, phosphorus, 
      and magnesium (79-110% DV), and of thiamin, vitamin B6 and vitamin K (32-37% 
      DV). Iron, potassium, zinc, and selenium are present in significant content 
      (14-61% DV). Cashews (100 g, raw) contain 113 milligrams (1.74 gr) 
      of beta-sitosterol.`,

    title: "hazelnuts",
    about: `The hazelnut is the fruit of the hazel tree and therefore includes any of the 
      nuts deriving from species of the genus Corylus, especially the nuts of the 
      species Corylus avellana. They are also known as cobnuts or filberts 
      according to species. Hazelnuts are used in baking and desserts, confectionery 
      to make praline, and also used in combination with chocolate for chocolate 
      truffles and products such as chocolate bars, hazelnut cocoa spread such as 
      Nutella, and Frangelico liqueur. Hazelnut oil, pressed from hazelnuts, is 
      strongly flavored and used as a cooking oil. Turkey and Italy are the world's 
      two largest producers of hazelnuts. A cob is roughly spherical to oval, 
      about 15-25 millimetres (5⁄8-1 inch) long and 10-15 mm (3⁄8-5⁄8 in) in 
      diameter, with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell, while a 
      filbert is more elongated, being about twice as long as its diameter. The nut 
      falls out of the husk when ripe, about seven to eight months after pollination. 
      The kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted or ground into a 
      paste. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin, which is sometimes removed before 
      cooking.`,
    nutrition: `Raw hazelnuts are 5% water, 61% fat, 17% carbohydrates, and 15% protein 
     . In a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference amount, raw hazelnuts supply 
      2,630 kilojoules (628 kilocalories) of food energy and are a rich source (20% 
      or more of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients (see 
      table).Hazelnuts contain particularly high amounts of protein, dietary fiber, 
      vitamin E, iron, thiamin, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium, all exceeding 
      30% DV. Several B vitamins have appreciable content. In lesser but 
      still significant amounts (moderate content, 10-19% DV) are vitamin K, calcium, 
      zinc, and potassium.Hazelnuts are a rich source of dietary fat, 
      accounting for 93% DV in a 100-gram amount. The fat components are 
      monounsaturated fat as oleic acid (75% of total), polyunsaturated fat mainly as 
      linoleic acid (13% of total), and saturated fat, mainly as palmitic acid and 
      stearic acid (together, 7% of total).`,

    title: "almonds",
    about: `The almond (Prunus amygdalus, syn. Prunus dulcis) is a species of tree native 
      to Iran and surrounding countries, including the Levant. The almond is 
      also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the 
      genus Prunus, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus, 
      distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) 
      surrounding the seed. The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an 
      outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut. Shelling 
      almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold 
      shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been 
      treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal 
      the white embryo. Once almonds are cleaned and processed, they can be stored 
      over time. Almonds are used in many food cuisines, often featuring prominently 
      in desserts, such as marzipan.The almond tree prospers in a moderate 
      Mediterranean climate with cool winter weather. California produces over half 
      of the world's almond supply. Due to high acreage and water demand for almond 
      cultivation, and need for pesticides, California almond production may be 
      unsustainable, especially during the persistent drought and heat from climate 
      change in the 21st century. Droughts in California have caused some 
      producers to leave the industry, leading to lower supply and increased 
      prices.`,
    nutrition: `Almonds are 4% water, 22% carbohydrates, 21% protein, and 50% fat. In 
      a 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference amount, almonds supply 2,420 kilojoules (579 
      kilocalories) of food energy. The almond is a nutritionally dense food, 
      providing a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins 
      riboflavin and niacin, vitamin E, and the essential minerals calcium, copper, 
      iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. Almonds are a moderate source 
      (10-19% DV) of the B vitamins thiamine, vitamin B6, and folate, choline, and 
      the essential mineral potassium. They also contain substantial dietary fiber, 
      the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, and the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic 
      acid. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds are a source of phytosterols such as 
      beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol.`,
